Assignment # 2 

Create a GitHub workflow that will run a python file which will display the contents of a csv file as a report. Please use the csv file included in this assignment (filename: data.csv)

The python file should be executed using the following commands:
python convert.py --input data.csv

the csv filename should not be hardcoded into your python file
The GitHub workflow should run in your own VM
The logs on your workflow should be similar to the following format:
| id | name | hash |
| 123 | john | #f1a |

Submit your python file here, then include a link to your GitHub repository.

If your repository is set to private, please add 'stonedleaf' to the repository's list of viewers / collaborators. This can be found in your repository Settings.


Create a python File that read and display the csv File with the same format as this 
| id | name | hash |
| 123 | john | #f1a |

1. Create a github workflow for the python file to be read.
	A. Create a yml file to read PythonFile in the same workflow

2. Add/create a python File to the same workflow named "greetings.py" 

In Order to run a python file you have to read the python file in the script by calling the file name 


for yaml file code to run python file:
name: Run Python Script

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
  workflow_dispatch:

jobs:
  run-python-script:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
    # Step 1: Check out the code
    - name: Check out repository
      uses: actions/checkout@v3

    # Step 2: Set up Python
    - name: Set up Python
      uses: actions/setup-python@v4
      with:
        python-version: 3.10  # Specify the Python version

    # Step 3: Install dependencies (optional)
    - name: Install dependencies
      run: |
        python -m pip install --upgrade pip
        pip install -r requirements.txt  # If your script has dependencies

    # Step 4: Run the Python script
    - name: Run Python script
      run: python script.py  # Replace 'script.py' with your file name
